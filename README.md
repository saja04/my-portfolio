# My-Portfolio
This repository holds my personal web page, where you can get to know me and my skills.
It was created all by myself using Node.js for the API side and React.js for the client side.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED IN THIS PROJECT:
  * JavaScript as main language
  * Node.js for server side and React.js for client side
  * Modularized vanilla CSS for styled components
  * Using Vite for the building process
  * Used React libraries like [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/) for in-page notifications or [react-spinners](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners) for some loading animations
  * Used [NodeMailer](https://nodemailer.com/) for the contact form wich sends me an email with the information

DISCLAIMER! this project is still in development, although the web page is actually usable and completely functional, I'm constantly adding features or solving issues.
You can report bugs directly in the repository page: [Issues](https://github.com/saja04/my-portfolio/issues)
